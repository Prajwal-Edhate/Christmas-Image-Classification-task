# Christmas Image Classification Challenge

## Introduction
The challenge is to train a Convolutional Neural Network (2D CNN) Model to classify the test images into 8 different classes including cookies, presents, santa, deer, etc. as per the training dataset made available.

The **model.py** file including **model_1.py, model_2.py, model_3.py** are different CNN models, implemented from scratch based on Resnet, ConvNext, EfficientNet, etc.

## To Train and Evaluate result

To train the file simply execute **train.py** and for evaluation, execute **eval.py**. The results will be stored in a .csv file

```bash
python train.py
```
```bash
python eval.py
```
